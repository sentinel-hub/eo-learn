All contributors agree to follow our [Code of Conduct][code-of-conduct].

**eo-learn** is distributed under the [MIT license][license]. When contributing
code to the library, you agree to its terms and conditions. If you would like to
keep parts of your contribution private, you can contact us to discuss about
the best solution.

For any question, feel free to contact us at [eoresearch@sinergise.com](eoresearch@sinergise.com) or through our [Forum][sh-forum].

## Bug Reports

We strive to provide high-quality working code, but bugs happen nevertheless.

When reporting a bug, please check [here][open-bug-list] whether
the bug was already reported. If not, open an issue with the **bug** label and
report the following information:

* Issue description
* How to reproduce the issue
* Expected outcome
* Actual outcome
* OS and package versions

This information helps us to reproduce, pinpoint, and fix the reported issue.

If you are not sure whether the odd behaviour is a bug or a _feature_, best to open an issue and clarify.

## Feature Requests

Existing feature requests can be found [here][existing-feature-requests].

A new feature request can be created by opening a new issue with the **enhancement** label, and describing how the feature would benefit the **eo-learn** community. Providing an example use-case would help assessing the scope of the feature request.

## Pull Requests

The GitHub Pull Request (PR) mechanism is the best option to contribute code to the library. Users can fork the repository, make their contribution to their local fork and create a PR to add those changes to the codebase. GitHub provides excellent tutorials on how the [fork and pull][fork-and-pull] mechanism work, and on how to best [create a PR][create-pr].

Existing PRs can be found [here][existing-prs]. Before creating new PRs, you should check whether someone else has contributed a similar feature, and if so, you can add your input to the existing code review.

The following guidelines should be observed when creating a PR.

### General guidelines

* Where applicable, create your contribution in a new branch of your fork based on the `develop` branch, as the `master` branch is aligned to the released package on [PyPI][pypi]. Upon completion of the code review, the branch will be merged into `develop` and, at the next package release, into `master`.

* Document your PR to help maintainers understand and review your contribution. The PR should include:

  * Description of contribution;
  * Required testing;
  * Link to issue/feature request.

* Your contribution should include unit tests, to test correct behaviour of the new feature and to lower the maintenance effort. Bug fixes as well as new features should include unit tests. When submitting the PR, check whether the Travis CI testing returns any errors, and if it does, please try to fix the issues causing failure. A test `EOPatch` is made available [here][test-eo-patch] with data for each `FeatureType`. Unit tests evaluating the correctness of new tasks should use data available in this `EOPatch`. New fields useful for testing purposes can be added, but should be consistent with the `bbox` and `timestamp` of the `EOPatch`. To execute all unit tests locally on you machine, use the command: `pytest` from the main folder. See also the [examples/README.md](examples/README.md) for how to setup you SentinelHub account and local config for testing.

* Try to keep contributions small, as this speeds up the reviewing process. In the case of large contributions, e.g. a new complex `EOTask`, it's best to contact us first to review the scope of the contribution.

* Keep API compatibility in mind, in particular when contributing a new `EOTask`. In general, all new tasks should adhere to the modularity of **eo-learn**. Check the Section below for more information on how to contribute an `EOTask`.

* New features or tasks should be appropriately commented using Sphinx style docstrings. The documentation uses the [PEP-8][pep-8] formatting guidelines. [Pylint][pylint] is used to check the coding standard. Therefore, please run `pylint */ *.py` from the the main folder, which contains the `pylintrc` file, to make sure your contribution is scored `10.0/10.0`.

### Development environment

* Get the latest development version by creating a fork and clone the repo:

```bash
git clone git@github.com:<username>/eo-learn.git
```

* Make sure that you have python 3 installed, i.e. version 3.5 or higher. See [Python downloads][python] for general Python versions or [Anaconda distributions][conda] for using Conda.

* All **eo-learn** packages can be installed at once using `python install_all.py -e`. To install each package separately, run `pip install -e <package_folder>`. We strongly recommend initializing a virtual environment before installing the required packages. For example by using Python Package Index (PyPI) and virtualenv:

```bash
cd eo-learn
# The following creates the virtual environment in the ".env" folder.
virtualenv --python python3 .env
source .env/bin/activate

# The following installs all eo-learn subpackages and development packages
# using PyPI in the activated virtualenv environment.
python install_all.py -e
pip install -r requirements-dev.txt -r requirements-docs.txt
```

Or alternatively by using Conda:

```bash
cd eo-learn
# The following creates the virtual environment named "dev_eolearn" where the
# Conda installation in located. ipykernel enables Jupyter (using
# nb_conda_kernels) to select the environment as a kernel. ipywidgets enables
# Jupyter to show the progress bar of EOExecutor without raising an error.
conda create -n dev_eolearn python=3.7 ipykernel ipywidgets
conda activate dev_eolearn

# The following installs all eo-learn subpackages and development packages
# using PyPI in the activated Conda environment.
python install_all.py -e
pip install -r requirements-dev.txt -r requirements-docs.txt
```

**Note:** to reduce later merge conflicts, always pull the latest version of the `develop` branch from the upstream eo-learn repository ([located here][dev-branch]) to your fork before starting the work on your PR.

### Contribute an `EOTask`

`EOTask`s allow to apply **eo-learn** workflows to different use-cases, adapting to imaging sources and
processing chain. If you think a task is general enough to be useful to the community, then we would
be delighted to include it into the library.

`EOTask`s are currently grouped by scope, e.g. core, IO, masks, and so on. A list of implemented
tasks can be found in the [documentation][existing-eo-tasks]. The following code snippet shows how
to create your own `EOTask`

```python
class FooTask(EOTask):
    def __init__(self, foo_params):
        self.foo_params = foo_params

    def execute(self, eopatch, *, runtime_params):
        # do what foo does on input eopatch and return it
        return eopatch
```

When creating a new task, bear in mind the following:

* Tasks should be as modular as possible, facilitating task re-use and sharing.
* An `EOTask` should perform a well-defined operation on the input eopatch(es). If the operation could be split into atomic sub-operations that could be used separately, then consider splitting the task into multiple tasks. Similarly, if tasks share the bulk of the implementation but differ in a minority of implementation, consider using Base classes and inheritance. The interpolation tasks represent a good example of this.
* Tasks should be as generalizable as possible, therefore hard-coding of task parameters or `EOPatch` feature types should be avoided. Use the `EOTask._parse_features` method to parse input features in a task, and pass task parameters as arguments, either in the constructor, or at run-time.
* If in doubt on whether a task is general enough to be of interest to the community, or you are not sure to which sub-package to contribute your task to, send us an email or open a [feature request](#feature-requests).

Looking forward to include your contributions into **eo-learn**.
