    Tasks computes clusters on selected features using `sklearn.cluster.AgglomerativeClustering`.

            n_clusters must be None nd compute_full_tree must be True

        :param affinity: Metric used to compute the linkage. Can be “euclidean”, “l1”, “l2”, “manhattan”, “cosine”.

            sets of observation. The algorithm will merge the pairs of cluster that minimize this criterion.
            - ward minimizes the variance of the clusters being merged.
            - average uses the average of the distances of each observation of the two sets.
            - complete or maximum linkage uses the maximum distances between all observations of the two sets.
            - single uses the minimum of the distances between all observations of the two sets.

            structure of the data. This can be a connectivity matrix itself or a callable that transforms the data into
            a connectivity matrix, such as derived from neighbors_graph. If set to None it uses the graph that has
            adjacent pixels connected.
