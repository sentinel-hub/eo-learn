class TrainTestSplitTask(EOTask):
    """Randomly assign each pixel or groups of pixels to multiple subsets (e.g., test/train/validate).

    When sampling PER_PIXEL the input feature only specifies the shape of the output feature. For PER_CLASS and
    PER_VALUE the input MASK_TIMELESS feature should group together pixels with similar properties, e.g. polygon ids,
    connected component ids, etc. The task then ensures that such groups are kept together (so the whole polygon is
    either in train or test).

    There are three modes of split operation:

    - :attr:`PER_PIXEL<eolearn.ml_tools.train_test_split.TrainTestSplitType.PER_PIXEL>` (default), where pixels are
      assigned to a subset randomly, regardless of their value,

    - :attr:`PER_CLASS<eolearn.ml_tools.train_test_split.TrainTestSplitType.PER_CLASS>`, where pixels of the same value
      are assigned to the same subset,

    - :attr:`PER_VALUE<eolearn.ml_tools.train_test_split.TrainTestSplitType.PER_VALUE>`, where pixels of the same value
      are assigned to the same subset consistently across EOPatches. In other words, if a group of pixels of the same
      value lies on multiple EOPatches, they are assigned to the same subset in all EOPatches. In this case, the `seed`
      argument of the `execute` method is ignored.

    Classes are defined by a list of cumulative probabilities, passed as the `bins` argument, the same way as the `bins`
    argument in `numpy.digitize <https://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy/reference/generated/numpy.digitize.html>`_. Valid
    classes are enumerated from 1 onward and if ignore_values is provided, all values equal to it get assigned to class
    0.

    To get a train/test split as 80/20, bins argument should be provided as `bins=[0.8]`.

    To get a train/val/test split as 60/20/20, bins argument should be provided as `bins=[0.6, 0.8]`.

    Splits can also be made into as many subsets as desired, e.g., `bins=[0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.7, 0.9]`.

    After execution each pixel will have a value representing the train, test and/or validation set stored in the
    output feature.
