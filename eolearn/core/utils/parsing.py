class FeatureParser:
    """Class for parsing a variety of feature specifications into a streamlined format.

    This class takes care of parsing multiple inputs that specify features and includes some additional options:

    - Fix allowed types, which raises an appropriate exception if a forbidden type is detected.
    - Parsing directly or parsing over an EOPatch. If an EOPatch object is provided the parser fails if a specified
      feature is missing from the EOPatch. Because EOPatch objects are usually provided to EOTasks at runtime, the
      parser preprocesses and validates the input feature specifications at initialization to ensure exceptions at an
      appropriate point.
    - The user can provide ellipsis `...` as a way to specify all features. When combined with a feature type it is
      understood as all features of a given type. When using `...` an EOPatch must be provided when parsing features,
      except when used only for `BBOX` and `TIMESTAMPS` features.
    - The parser can output pairs `(feature_type, feature_name)` or triples `(feature_type, old_name, new_name)`, which
      come in hand in many cases. If the user does not provide an explicit new name, the `old_name` and `new_name` are
      equal.

    The main input formats are as follows:

    1. Ellipsis `...` signify that all features of all types should be parsed.

    2. Input representing a single feature, where the first element is a `FeatureType` element and the other
       (or two for renaming) is a string.

    3. Dictionary mapping `feature_type` keys to sequences of feature names. Feature names are either a sequence of
       strings, pairs of shape `(old_name, new_name)` or `...`. Example:

        .. code-block:: python

            {
                FeatureType.DATA: [
                    ('S2-BANDS', 'INTERPOLATED_S2_BANDS'),
                    ('L8-BANDS', 'INTERPOLATED_L8_BANDS'),
                    'NDVI',
                    'NDWI',
                },
                FeatureType.MASK: ...
            }

    4. Sequences of elements, each describing a feature. When describing all features of a given feature type use
       `(feature_type, ...)`. For specific features one can use `(feature_type, feature_name)` or even
       `(feature_type, old_name, new_name)` for renaming.

        .. code-block:: python

            [
                (FeatureType.DATA, 'BANDS'),
                (FeatureType.MASK, 'CLOUD_MASK', 'NEW_CLOUD_MASK'),
            ]

    Outputs of the FeatureParser are:

    - For `get_features` a list of pairs `(feature_type, feature_name)`.
    - For `get_renamed_features` a list of triples `(feature_type, old_name, new_name)`.
