    """
    Task to compute blobs

    A blob is a region of an image in which some properties are constant or approximately constant; all the points in a
    blob can be considered in some sense to be similar to each other.

    3 methods are implemented: The Laplacian of Gaussian (LoG), the difference of Gaussian approach (DoG) and the
    determinant of the Hessian (DoH).

    The output is a FeatureType.DATA where the radius of each blob is stored in his center.
    ie : If blob[date, i, j, 0] = 5 then a blob of radius 5 is present at the coordinate (i, j)

    The task uses skimage.feature.blob_log or skimage.feature.blob_dog or skimage.feature.blob_doh to extract the blobs.

    The input image must be in [-1,1] range.

    :param feature: A feature that will be used and a new feature name where data will be saved. If new name is not
                    specified it will be saved with name '<feature_name>_BLOB'

                    Example: (FeatureType.DATA, 'bands') or (FeatureType.DATA, 'bands', 'blob')

    :type feature: (FeatureType, str) or (FeatureType, str, str)
    :param blob_object: Name of the blob method to use
    :type blob_object: skimage.feature.blob_*
    :param blob_parameters: List of parameters to be passed to the blob function. Below a list of such parameters.
    :type blob_paramters: dict
    :param min_sigma: The minimum standard deviation for Gaussian Kernel. Keep this low to detect smaller blobs
    :type min_sigma: float
    :param max_sigma: The maximum standard deviation for Gaussian Kernel. Keep this high to detect larger blobs
    :type max_sigma: float
    :param threshold: The absolute lower bound for scale space maxima. Local maxima smaller than thresh are ignored.
                        Reduce this to detect blobs with less intensity
    :type threshold: float
    :param overlap: A value between 0 and 1. If the area of two blobs overlaps by a fraction greater than threshold,
                    the smaller blob is eliminated
    :type overlap: float
    :param num_sigma: For ‘Log’ and ‘DoH’: The number of intermediate values of standard deviations to consider between
                        min_sigma and max_sigma
    :type num_sigma: int
    :param log_scale: For ‘Log’ and ‘DoH’: If set intermediate values of standard deviations are interpolated using a
                        logarithmic scale to the base 10. If not, linear interpolation is used
    :type log_scale: bool
    :param sigma_ratio: For ‘DoG’: The ratio between the standard deviation of Gaussian Kernels used for computing the
                        Difference of Gaussians
    :type sigma_ratio: float
